# IPA tools for Godot Engine

An editor to update your Godot Engine Project without re-exporting!

Ever wanted to stop hopping between your Mac and Windows/Linux PCs when developing an iOS Project? This is the project for you!
If you don't have a Mac and you need to export for the first time, use this project: https://github.com/mak448a/build-ios

## Requirements
- gh cli
- git cli

## Tutorial
Check the tutorial directory out. I should probably put this in the readme, but I'm trying to get this out quickly.

## Privacy Policy
I don't collect any data.
This project uses GitHub and Dropbox, so you will have to check the privacy policies for each service.

If you get an `AuthError('expired_access_token', None))`, that means that you need to get a new oauth token from dropbox.
